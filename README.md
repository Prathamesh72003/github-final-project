# Simple Interest Calculator

A simple calculator that computes the **Simple Interest** based on the principal amount, time period in years, and annual rate of interest.

## 📋 Description

This project provides a basic implementation of a simple interest calculator. The formula used is: Simple Interest = (P × T × R) / 100

Where:
- **P** = Principal amount (initial investment)
- **T** = Time period in years
- **R** = Annual rate of interest

## 📝 Input

The user needs to provide the following inputs:
1. **P**: Principal amount (in units of currency)
2. **T**: Time period (in years)
3. **R**: Annual rate of interest (as a percentage)

## 💡 Output

The calculator will output the **Simple Interest**, calculated as: Simple Interest = P × T × R
